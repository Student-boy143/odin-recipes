    <p>Pav Bhaji is a popular Indian street food consisting of a spicy vegetable mash (bhaji) served with buttered, toasted bread rolls (pav).

It is typically served with chopped onions, a wedge of lemon, and a dollop of butter. The dish is flavorful, aromatic, and enjoyed as a snack or meal, especially in Mumbai and other parts of India.
