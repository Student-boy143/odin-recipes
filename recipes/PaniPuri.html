    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pani Puri, also known as Golgappa or Phuchkas, is a popular street food in India. It consists of crispy, round hollow puris filled with a combination of tangy, spicy water (pani), and a mix of potatoes, chickpeas, and various chutneys. The puris are delicate and crunchy, and the burst of flavorful liquid inside provides a unique, mouthwatering experience. 
        <br>
    Typically served as a snack or appetizer, Pani Puri is loved for its refreshing taste and the balance of spice, tang, and sweetness in the filling. Itâ€™s enjoyed in many regions across India with slight variations in the preparation of the fillings and pani.</p>
